# senti-sys-practice
To a spin at sentiment analysis using python. sentiment analysis program of reviews of certain product on an e commerce website.

My Work Flow for this project: so far....

1. **Load the Dataset:** Started by loading the CSV file containing the review dataset into my Python environment. and using `pandas` library to read the CSV file and create a dataframe.

2. **Preprocessing:** Preprocess the review text to prepare it for analysis. This may involve steps such as removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, handling stopwords, and addressing any other specific requirements based on your dataset. The goal is to clean and standardize the text data.

        - Text Cleaning: Remove unnecessary elements like punctuation, special characters, and URLs from the text.

        - Lowercasing: Convert the text to lowercase to ensure consistency and avoid duplicating words based on case.

        - Tokenization: Split the text into individual words or tokens to process them separately.

        - Stopword Removal: Eliminate common words that do not carry significant meaning, known as stopwords. This step helps to focus on content words that contribute to sentiment.

        - Stemming: Reduce words to their base or root form to avoid multiple versions of the same word. Choose between stemming (reducing words to their core form)... You can also use lemmatization (reducing words to their dictionary form) choose based on your preferences.


3. **Splitting the Data:** Split the dataset into features (review text) and labels (sentiment). Separate the review text column from the sentiment label column in your dataframe.

4. **Feature Extraction:** Convert the preprocessed review text into numerical features that can be used for machine learning. Common techniques include TF-IDF vectorization, bag-of-words representation, or word embeddings. This step transforms the textual data into a format suitable for training machine learning models.

5. **Train-Test Split:** Split your data into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train your sentiment analysis model, and the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance. A typical split can be 70-80% for training and 20-30% for testing.

6. **Model Training:** Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for sentiment analysis, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or neural networks. Train your model using the training data and the corresponding sentiment labels.

7. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model's performance using the testing data. Calculate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score to assess how well the model predicts sentiment on unseen data. Adjust hyperparameters or try different algorithms if necessary.

8. **Model Deployment:** If you are satisfied with the model's performance, save the trained model to disk for future use or deployment in a production environment. This allows you to load the model and use it to classify sentiments of new reviews.

Remember to follow best practices, such as handling class imbalance, performing cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning, and interpreting the results of your model.
