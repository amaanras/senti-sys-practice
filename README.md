# Sentiment Analysis for Product Reviews

## Project Overview

This project is a small-scale sentiment analysis application that aims to understand and analyze sentiment in product reviews. It utilizes machine learning techniques to automatically classify the sentiment (positive or negative) expressed in the reviews.

The project consists of the following main steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the product review dataset for analysis.
2. Feature Extraction: Converting the preprocessed review text into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.
3. Train-Test Split: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
4. Model Training: Training a sentiment analysis model using machine learning algorithms.
5. Performance Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

This project serves as a learning exercise to gain insights into machine learning techniques and their application in sentiment analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install the required packages:

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`



## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset: Provide your own product review dataset or use the provided dataset file in CSV format.

2. Preprocess the data: Run the `preprocess.py` script to clean and preprocess the review text.

3. Run the `training.py` for
        - Extracting the features, convert the preprocessed review text into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
        - Training the model, train the sentiment analysis model on the training data.
        - Evaluating the model, assess the model's performance on the testing data.


## Companies and Benefits

Sentiment analysis has various applications across industries. Companies that rely on customer feedback, reviews, and social media data can benefit from sentiment analysis in the following ways:

- Customer Insights: Gain insights into customer opinions, preferences, and satisfaction levels.
- Brand Monitoring: Monitor and analyze brand sentiment to identify potential issues or opportunities.
- Reputation Management: Assess public sentiment towards a company or brand and take necessary actions.
- Product Improvement: Analyze feedback to identify areas of improvement for products or services.
- Market Research: Understand market trends, customer preferences, and competitors' performance.

By automating sentiment analysis, companies can efficiently process large volumes of data, make data-driven decisions, and improve customer experiences.
